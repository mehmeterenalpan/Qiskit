## Getting Started üöÄ
Follow these steps to dive into quantum programming with Qiskit:

### 1. Install Qiskit
Install Qiskit via pip:
```bash
pip install qiskit
```

### 2. Run a Simple Quantum Circuit
Here‚Äôs a quick example to create and simulate a Bell state:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

# Create a Quantum Circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)         # Apply Hadamard gate
qc.cx(0, 1)     # Apply CNOT gate
qc.measure_all() # Measure all qubits

# Simulate the Circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator).result()
counts = result.get_counts()

print("Result:", counts)
```

### 3. Access Real Quantum Hardware
Sign up on [IBM Quantum](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and add your API token:
```python
from qiskit import IBMQ
IBMQ.save_account('YOUR_API_TOKEN', overwrite=True)
```
